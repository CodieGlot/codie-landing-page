### First steps

In this set of articles, you'll learn the **core fundamentals** of Nest. To get familiar with the essential building blocks of Nest applications, we'll build a basic CRUD application with features that cover a lot of ground at an introductory level.

#### Language

We're in love with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), but above all - we love [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). That's why Nest is compatible with both TypeScript and **pure JavaScript**. Nest takes advantage of the latest language features, so to use it with vanilla JavaScript we need a [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) compiler.

We'll mostly use TypeScript in the examples we provide, but you can always **switch the code snippets** to vanilla JavaScript syntax (simply click to toggle the language button in the upper right hand corner of each snippet).

#### Prerequisites

Please make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 16) is installed on your operating system.

#### Setup

Setting up a new project is quite simple with the [Nest CLI](/cli/overview). With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, you can create a new Nest project with the following commands in your OS terminal:

```bash
$ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new project-name
```

> **NOTE** To create a new project with TypeScript's [stricter](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict) feature set, pass the `--strict` flag to the `nest new` command.

## Brief Introduction

As a second-year student majoring in Software Engineering at [FPT University Danang](https://dnuni.fpt.edu.vn/), I am currently eager and motivated to find part-time jobs that can fit my academic schedule while also providing opportunities to enhance my programming skills. I am confident that I have the knowledge and skills required to take on such jobs and I am excited about the prospect of contributing to a company while gaining valuable experience in the field.

```TypeScript
const MyProfile: ICandidateProfile = {
    name: "Nguyen Nhat Huy",
    age: 19,
    position: "Backend Developer",
    major: "Software Engineering"
}
```

## Technologies

- [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/): A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and reliable server-side applications.
- [ReactJs](https://react.dev/): A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces that are declarative, efficient, and easy to maintain.
- [Angular](https://angular.io/): A comprehensive TypeScript-based framework for building dynamic web applications with a powerful set of features for building complex, scalable, and performant front-end applications.
- [Solana Blockchain](https://solana.com/): A high-performance, low-cost blockchain platform designed for building decentralized applications at scale, using a unique architecture that delivers fast transaction processing times and high throughput.

> **NOTE** While I may not be familiar with all of the technologies mentioned, I have a pretty strong foundation in developing backend servers using NestJS
