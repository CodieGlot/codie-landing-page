### First steps

In this set of articles, you'll learn the **core fundamentals** of Nest. To get familiar with the essential building blocks of Nest applications, we'll build a basic CRUD application with features that cover a lot of ground at an introductory level.

#### Language

We're in love with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), but above all - we love [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). That's why Nest is compatible with both TypeScript and **pure JavaScript**. Nest takes advantage of the latest language features, so to use it with vanilla JavaScript we need a [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) compiler.

We'll mostly use TypeScript in the examples we provide, but you can always **switch the code snippets** to vanilla JavaScript syntax (simply click to toggle the language button in the upper right hand corner of each snippet).

#### Prerequisites

Please make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 16) is installed on your operating system.

#### Setup

Setting up a new project is quite simple with the [Nest CLI](/cli/overview). With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, you can create a new Nest project with the following commands in your OS terminal:

```bash
$ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new project-name
```

> **NOTE** To create a new project with TypeScript's [stricter](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict) feature set, pass the `--strict` flag to the `nest new` command.
